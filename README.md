This specific source code is complied in Visual Studios 2015 in windows 10.

Some assumptions for the source code
1) We will only deal with the specific case of 5 processes and 3 resources
2) The user has the ability to enter specific values for each resource and processes (i.e. Allocation and Max)
3) Each index for Allocation and Max will be filled with a given value and the rest will be calculated
4) We will assume that the user will only enter intergers and never characters for inputs
5) Invalid values will misbehave (negative numbers)
