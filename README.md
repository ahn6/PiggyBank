## Compile Environment
This specific source code is complied in Visual Studios 2015 in windows 10.

## Program Specification
Some assumptions are made for the program:
1) The program only deals with the specific case of 5 processes and 3 resources
2) User has the ability to enter specific values for each resource and process (i.e. Allocation and Maximum parameters)
3) Each index for Allocation and Max are filled with given values and the rest are calculated in the run time
4) Only integer is allowed for input data type
5) Invalid values such as negative numbers will cause the program to misbehave
